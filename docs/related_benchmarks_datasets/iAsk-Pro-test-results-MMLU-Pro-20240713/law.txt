Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made.

The tenant's failure to pay rent directly breaches this agreement. The corporation and health club are subtenants and their obligations are primarily to their immediate lessors (the corporation to the tenant, and the health club to the corporation).\n\nTherefore, while the landlord may have claims against subtenants for use and occupancy or unjust enrichment, the most straightforward claim for past due rent is against the tenant who has a direct contractual obligation under the original lease.\n\nAnswer: H","question":"A landlord owned a large building in the city.

Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.

However, since the coat belonged to the man, he cannot be guilty of larceny for taking his own property.

{"number":1444,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. The contract between the nephew and the agent stipulated that the agent would be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The key issue here is whether the agent's duty to receive the commission was contingent upon the actual consummation of the sale and transfer of title, which did not occur due to the developer's repudiation.\n\nThe agent found a buyer and facilitated a signed agreement between the nephew and the developer. However, since the sale was not consummated, it can be argued that the condition precedent for paying the commission (the consummation of the sale) was not met. Therefore, under strict contract terms, no commission would be due.\n\nHowever, there is an argument to be made that if the failure to consummate was beyond the agent's control and he fulfilled his obligations under the brokerage agreement (finding a ready, willing, and able buyer), he might still be entitled to his commission. This would depend on whether courts interpret such conditions as being excused when prevented by external factors.\n\nGiven these considerations, option I seems most aligned with standard contractual interpretations where conditions precedent are strictly enforced unless explicitly excused.\n\nAnswer: I","question":"A nephew inherited a large parcel of unimproved land from his uncle.

Thus, there was no true agreement to commit the crime, which negates conspiracy.\n\nCriminal facilitation involves providing assistance or encouragement to someone who commits a crime, knowing that it will aid in the commission of the crime.

This doctrine does not prioritize based on who used the water first (as opposed to prior appropriation).

Therefore, the rancher’s use for domestic purposes would typically be considered superior to the millionaire's use for irrigation.\n\nAnswer: H","question":"A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate.

The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed.

She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor.

The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch.

The restaurant's policy imposes a fine as a penalty rather than as a measure of actual damages incurred by the restaurant due to the employee's smoking.

These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax.
