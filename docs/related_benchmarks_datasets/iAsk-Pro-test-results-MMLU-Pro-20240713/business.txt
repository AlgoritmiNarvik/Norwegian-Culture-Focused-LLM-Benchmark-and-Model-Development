{"number":408,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA) guidelines, a surviving spouse is eligible for a one-time lump-sum death payment of $255.

A limited payment policy requires premiums to be paid over a shorter period but provides coverage for a longer term.\n\nGiven the options provided, without specific premium rates for each type of policy, it's challenging to determine exact costs.

{"number":735,"response":"Explanation: To calculate the effective yield of a bond, we need to consider both the annual interest payment and any capital gain or loss if the bond is purchased at a price different from its face value.\n\n1. **Annual Interest Payment**: The bond has a coupon rate of 6.5%, so it pays $65 annually (6.5% of $1,000).\n\n2. **Purchase Price**: The bond is purchased at 8.25% yield, which means it is bought at a discount or premium relative to its face value. However, since the purchase price isn't explicitly given in dollar terms, we'll assume \"8(1/4)\" refers to a percentage yield rather than a price.\n\n3. **Effective Yield Calculation**:\n   - If we assume the bond's purchase price reflects an 8.25% yield, we can use the formula for current yield:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Interest Payment}}{\\text{Purchase Price}}\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging for Purchase Price:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Purchase Price} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Interest Payment}}{\\text{Current Yield}} = \\frac{65}{0.0825} \\approx 787.88\n     \\]\n\n4. **Effective Yield**:\n   - The effective yield considers both the coupon payment and the capital gain/loss over the bond's life.\n   - Since we are asked for an approximate answer to the nearest tenth of a percent, we can use the simplified formula for effective yield:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Effective Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Coupon Payment} + (\\text{Face Value} - \\text{Purchase Price}) / n}{\\text{Average of Face Value and Purchase Price}}\n     \\]\n   - For simplicity, assuming n (years to maturity) is large enough that capital gain/loss per year is small:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Effective Yield} = \\frac{65 + (1000 - 787.88) / n}{(1000 + 787.88) / 2}\n     \\]\n   - Given that this calculation involves approximations and simplifications, let's compare it with standard yields provided in choices.\n\nGiven these calculations and approximations, the closest match to our calculated effective yield would be:\n\nAnswer: B","question":"What is the effective yield of a 6(1/2)% bond with a face value of $1,000 purchased at 8(1/4) ?
