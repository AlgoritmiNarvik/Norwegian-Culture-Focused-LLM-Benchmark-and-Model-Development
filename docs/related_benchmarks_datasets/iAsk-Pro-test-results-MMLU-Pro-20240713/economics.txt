Instead, it aligns with the idea that only a few might outperform due to skill or luck, while the majority do not.\n\nAnswer: F","question":"Suppose that 100 separate firms were tested to determine how many of them \"beat the market\" using a Jensen-type regression, and it is found that 3 fund managers significantly do so.

{"number":7616,"response":"Explanation: To determine the range over which profit can be made and the point at which profit is maximized, we need to compare the revenue and cost schedules. The revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity, and profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost.\n\nGiven:\n- Price = $52.50 per thousand board feet\n\nWe need to find the range of production where total revenue exceeds total cost (profitable range) and identify the production level where this difference (profit) is maximized.\n\nWithout the specific cost schedule provided, we can only infer from the options given.

{"number":7679,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on international economics for help. The current account records a country's transactions with the rest of the world, including net trade in goods and services, net earnings on cross-border investments, and net transfer payments. A negative value on the current account (a current account deficit) means that the country is importing more than it is exporting.\n\nTo balance this deficit, there must be an offsetting positive value in the financial account or capital account. This is because the balance of payments must always sum to zero. Therefore, if a country has a negative value on its current account, it must have a positive value of equal magnitude on its capital account or financial account.\n\nAnswer: B","question":"If a country has a negative value on its current account then it must","choices":["have a negative value on its financial account.","have a positive value of equal magnitude on its capital account.","decrease its interest rates.","increase its export volume.","take a loan from the International Monetary Fund.","decrease its import volume.","appreciate its currency.","depreciate its currency.","pay that amount to its trading partners.","increase its interest rates."],"correct":"B","answer":"B","score":1}
{"number":7680,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. In an open economy with flexible exchange rates (Economy X), expansionary monetary policy typically leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency. This depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which tends to increase net exports. Therefore, expansionary monetary policy is more effective in Economy X because it will increase net exports, boosting overall economic activity.\n\nIn a closed economy (Economy Y), there are no effects on net exports since there is no trade with other countries. Thus, the impact of expansionary monetary policy is limited to domestic factors.\n\nAnswer: A","question":"Economy X is an open economy with flexible exchange rates. Economy Y is closed. Ceteris paribus expansionary monetary policy is","choices":["more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports.","more effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports.","equally effective in X and Y.","less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports."],"correct":"D","answer":"A","score":0}

The money supply can be influenced by various actions taken by the Federal Reserve (FED). \n\n- Lowering the discount rate (A) would make borrowing cheaper for banks, encouraging them to borrow more and increase the money supply.\n- Selling government securities in the secondary market (B) would take money out of circulation as buyers pay for these securities, leading to a decrease in the money supply.\n- Federal government spending less money (C) is fiscal policy, not directly related to the FED's control over the money supply.\n- Lowering reserve requirements (D) would allow banks to lend more of their deposits, increasing the money supply.\n\nThus, selling government securities in the secondary market is the action that would lead to a decrease in the money supply.\n\nAnswer: B","question":"Which of the following would lead to a decrease in the money supply?","choices":["The FED lowers the discount rate.","The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.","The federal government spends less money.","The FED lowers reserve requirements."],"correct":"B","answer":"B","score":1}
{"number":7683,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on monetary policy for help. The Federal Reserve can increase the money supply through three main actions:\n\n1. Lowering reserve requirements, which allows banks to lend more.\n2.

An expansionary monetary policy, also known as easy money policy, typically involves lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic activity.

{"number":7686,"response":"Explanation: Let's think step by step. When the demand for a product falls, it typically leads to a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity. Conversely, when the supply of a product increases, it generally leads to a decrease in the equilibrium price but an increase in the equilibrium quantity.\n\nCombining these two effects:\n1. The fall in demand will put downward pressure on both price and quantity.\n2. The increase in supply will put downward pressure on price but upward pressure on quantity.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price will definitely fall because both changes (decrease in demand and increase in supply) push the price downwards. However, the effect on equilibrium quantity is indeterminate because the decrease in demand pushes it down while the increase in supply pushes it up.\n\nAnswer: J","question":"Suppose the demand for a particular product falls while the supply simultaneously increases.
